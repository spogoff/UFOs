# UFOs

## Description

UFO Sightings showcases a web page created using a JavaScript array of objects as database. The website allows the user to filter the data table by 5 different filters.

## Technologies

* JavaScript
* HTML
* Bootstrap 

## Recommendations

Future versions of the website could modify the HTML code so that it allows for dropdown menus to be dependant on each other. So once a city is selected, the state and country filters allow only for the right ooptions.
